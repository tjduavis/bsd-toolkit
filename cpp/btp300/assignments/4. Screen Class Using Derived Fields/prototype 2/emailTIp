To convert a string to an int check to see if there are any non-digit character other than '-'
and if not then use atoi(stringEntered)
or sscanf(stringEntered, "%d", &myInt);
Store the converted int value in the derived class.
If the user presses Escape leave the original int value
in place.

BTW, you'll need to load the string at the start.  For this try
 sprintf(stringEntered,"%d", myInt)
