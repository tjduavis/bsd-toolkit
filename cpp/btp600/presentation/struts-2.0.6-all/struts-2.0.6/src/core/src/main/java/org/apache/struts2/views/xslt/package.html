<p>
The new xslt view supports an extensible Java XML adapter framework that makes
it easy to customize the XML rendering of objects and to incorporate structured
XML text and arbitarary DOM fragments into the output.
</p>
<p>
The XSLTResult class now uses an extensible adapter factory for rendering the
Struts action Java object tree to an XML DOM for consumption by the
stylesheet.  Users can easily register their own adapters to produce custom XML
views of Java types or simply extend a default "String" adapter and return
plain or XML text to be incorporated into the DOM.  The new adapter mechanism
is capable of proxying existing DOM trees and incorporating them into the
results, so you can freely mix DOMs produced from other sources into your
result tree.
</p>
<p>
A default java.util.Map adapter is also now provided to render Maps to XML.

Please see the javadoc on the AdapterFactory for more details.
