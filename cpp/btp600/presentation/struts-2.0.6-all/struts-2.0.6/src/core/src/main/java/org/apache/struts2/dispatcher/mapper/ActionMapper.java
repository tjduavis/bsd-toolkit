/**
 * <!-- START SNIPPET: javadoc -->
 *
 * Provide a mapping between HTTP requests and action invocation requests and vice-versa.
 * <p/>
 * When given an HttpServletRequest, the ActionMapper may return null if no action invocation request matches,
 * or it may return an {@link ActionMapping} that describes an action invocation for the framework to try.
 * <p/>
 * The ActionMapper is not required to guarantee that the {@link ActionMapping} returned be a real action or otherwise
 * ensure a valid request.
 * Accordingly, most ActionMappers do not need to consult the Struts configuration
 * just to determine if a request should be mapped.
 * <p/>
 * Just as requests can be mapped from HTTP to an action invocation, the opposite is true as well.
 * However, because HTTP requests (when shown in HTTP responses) must be in String form,
 * a String is returned rather than an actual request object.
 *
