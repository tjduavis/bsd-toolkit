<DIV class="preformatted"><DIV class="preformattedContent">
<PRE>	PSquad33	my biggest concerns are making sure we don't bite off more than we can chew and that we keep WebWork... WebWork
	jcarreira	Have you looked at Cameron's stuff?
	iroughley	what were your thoughts on Camerons checkins?
	PSquad33	i'm not interested in becoming a vehicle for distributing dojo
	iroughley	yes
	jcarreira	I wanted to talk to him about contributing his stuff back to dojo
	PSquad33	all the javascript widget stuff sounds like it is getting a little too far away from webwork. but still, it is interesting
	PSquad33	anyway, i'll be on and off
	iroughley	I like dojo as the transport, but as soon as you get too far into JS I am concerned abouot browser compatibility
	jcarreira	I like the idea of making the components dojo widgets, but I want the JSP tags to write out the dojo widgets... that way we can maintain server-side state
	jcarreira	yeah, that's a good reason to put it in dojo... more people using it = more compatibility testing
	iroughley	exactly
	PSquad33	are we going to support dojo entirely, or will this be optional stuff? i just don't want to divert focus
	PSquad33	maybe we should make an seperate project or something. do my concerns make sense?
	jcarreira	well, I think we should have an Ajax theme
	iroughley	I like using it as the transport, and the event stuff is good.
	jcarreira	I don't know... I think it's important to have rich widgets as part of the framework...
	PSquad33	sure -- but we can't abandon our base either
	jcarreira	...and they're going to do drag-n-drop, etc.
	PSquad33	people still use the plain old XHTML theme
	PSquad33	i want to keep the goals in sync
	PSquad33	anyway, my big concern is that I feel a bit left out of the loop -- and if I do, our users defintiely will
	iroughley	I guess my underlying issue with the code that cameron added, was that it had no dependency with webwork
	PSquad33	so you guys need to really hold my hand on this if you think this is the right direction to go
	PSquad33	show me the vision in simple to understand terms
	PSquad33	ian: exactly
	PSquad33	ian: that is exactly my concern -- we're going to fragment the user base at this rate
	jcarreira	yeah.. I don't want to get into the biz of maintaining add-ons to dojo
	iroughley	it could be used with or without webwork, and then we are developing for someone else
	jcarreira	I wanted to talk to him about contributing the JS stuff back to dojo, and we just use it
	jcarreira	I've been trying to think through if we need the server-side events too
	iroughley	so then move in the direction that I think we are going - tag libs around the attributes for the dojo elements
	jcarreira	yep
	iroughley	so that we can link into server side state
	jcarreira	Should we just maintain UI widget dependencies on the client-side?
	jcarreira	or should we try to implement a real MVC style where the model changes cause the correct view components to update?
	iroughley	this is a urious question
	iroughley	i like loose dependencies on the client, via topics
	iroughley	so far, for what I am doing it works well
	jcarreira	so the UI components just know to listen to topics and refresh themselves?
	iroughley	yes
	jcarreira	in that case it can just be a UI component theme
	iroughley	the caveat is that the components have a known grnularity, that is understood by the developer
	iroughley	yes
	jcarreira	except for the extra JSP attributes
	iroughley	and changed per theme
	jcarreira	what do you mean about the granularity?
	iroughley	you have to know that a remote div (for example) might get a list from the server, or render a domain object
	jcarreira	I was thinking the remote div would just get HTML and set its innerHtml
	iroughley	so when you call that div to refresh itself you are doing work to obtain the information
	jcarreira	that way it's just like a ww:action tag...
	iroughley	yes
	iroughley	the action does the work
	jcarreira	and if you have it like this:
	jcarreira	&lt;ww:remotediv action=&quot;foo&quot;/&gt;
	jcarreira	actually...
	jcarreira	this could just be a theme for the ww:action tag...
	jcarreira	...except it's not a UI tag
	iroughley	true
	jcarreira	but it could wrap a ww:action tag and delegate calls to it
	jcarreira	but maybe that's limiting its reusability
	jcarreira	&lt;ww:remotediv href=&quot;foo.action&quot;&gt;&lt;ww:action name=&quot;foo&quot;/&gt;&lt;/ww:remotediv&gt;
	jcarreira	the contents of the ww:remotediv would be the original content (no need for a separate call to load the content), then the href would be used when it refreshes
	iroughley	that's a good idea
	iroughley	i haven't had a chance to implement the initial content yet (as per your suggestion last week)
	jcarreira	what are the params to the remotediv tag?
	iroughley	so, i guess that the UI doesn't need to maintain dependencies on the client, just make calls via remote div's (or other components) and let the actions determine the state
	jcarreira	yeah
	jcarreira	but we need things like select boxes which can populate
	|&lt;--	PSquad33 has left efnet (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
	iroughley	is, url, updateFreq, loadingText, reloadingText, errortext, showErrorTransportText, topicName
	jcarreira	for example, if I'm shopping and I select a catalog, it should populate the product categories in a select list automatically
	jcarreira	...I'd also like to be able to have a lazy-loading tree widget
	iroughley	i agree
	jcarreira	the loadingText can go away.. just make it the body enclosed by the tag
	iroughley	that was my plan
	jcarreira	we need a way to tell it to load immediately... then the default text would be there while it loads the first time
	iroughley	:)
	iroughley	my idea exactly
	iroughley	monday I hope it will be done
	jcarreira	cool
	iroughley	could the select tag and tree tag use topics to refresh state from the server
	jcarreira	what do you mean?
	iroughley	then use DWR or dojo to obtain JS to refresh themselves
	jcarreira	ah
	--&gt;|	PSquad33 (~PSquad32@c-67-160-147-93.hsd1.or.comcast.net) has joined #webwork
	PSquad33	back
	PSquad33	sorry about that
	PSquad33	you guys still talking about stuff
	jcarreira	but where do they call to get the stuff to refresh themselves?
	PSquad33	?
	jcarreira	yep
	iroughley	yeah
	jcarreira	you need to bind something to DWR to populate the list, right?
	iroughley	the data has to be sourced from somewhere originally, right?
	iroughley	yep
	jcarreira	yeah... originally it might be in the action
	iroughley	exactly
	PSquad33	let me know when you guys are ready to talk strategy. i don't have much to add technically, but i want to make sure we are absolutely clear on our strategy and market perception.
	jcarreira	would we want to populate the data on the client?
	iroughley	what do you mean?
	jcarreira	pre-populate a data structure and select from there...
	|&lt;--	PSquad33 has left efnet (Remote host closed the connection)
	iroughley	personally I wouldn't - if you are using ajax the assumption is that the data may change, and should be refreshed from the server
	iroughley	that doesn;t mean that we shouldn't have a static tree widget
	jcarreira	I guess I don't know how DWR works... how do you tell it what to call? Can it load data from the session?
	iroughley	DWR (i think) makes a call to a method on a serverside object - like a spring BO
	jcarreira	can it access the session to get its data?
	iroughley	i would think that you could have it access a WW action, and return the session information from there
	iroughley	i haven't looked at it lately
	jcarreira	I'm asking Patrick... he keeps getting kicked off
	iroughley	do you want to try another IRC server?
	jcarreira	nah, it's his client
	jcarreira	he's got a cheesy shareware one for mac
	iroughley	ok - so if anyone changes the select list they update an element in the session - then the select list uses DWR to call an action with a list name (?) which obtains a refreshed (possibly) list from the session
	jcarreira	I was using an onChange() call... it uses bind() to call and set something into the session
	iroughley	that would work
	jcarreira	we need a way to make it easy for users to bind onChange to a call to the server
	jcarreira	You shouldn't have to write a JS function everytime
	--&gt;|	PSquad32_ (~chatzilla@c-67-160-147-93.hsd1.or.comcast.net) has joined #webwork
	PSquad32_	yo yo
	PSquad32_	chatzilla to the rescue
	jcarreira	ok, Patrick was just explaining DWR to me
	iroughley	but it's more complex than that, as it might not be the same element - it may be a different one
	iroughley	ok
	jcarreira	no, it shouldn't change anything client-side
	PSquad32_	so yeah, lemme know when you are ready to talk strategy. dojo doesn't seem to line up with what webwork is about at all, so i'm a bit worried
	jcarreira	it should make a call to the server, set some session state, then return and send a client-side topic message
	iroughley	ok - yes
	jcarreira	it's maybe a little more chatty, but it's simple to understand and model
	jcarreira	and very loosely coupled
	iroughley	could we set up each of the UI tags to define whether they send or update, and then wire it up for the users?
	iroughley	more chatty, but the calls are going to be very small
	jcarreira	what do you mean?
	jcarreira	I think each UI component should be able to be given a URL to hit with the new value onChange()
	jcarreira	and a topic to publish to
	iroughley	agreed
	iroughley	so that call will be small (not alot of data in the URL)
	jcarreira	and also have a topic to listen to that would load the value... so that would need a url to get the list
	iroughley	yes
	iroughley	and that call is going to be returning just the list, and not a complete HTML page - do the data being sent back to the client will be small
	jcarreira	yep.. but in what form does it return the list?
	jcarreira	...patrick, we're almost done with the Js stuff....
	iroughley	innerHTML?
	jcarreira	what does it mean if you set the innerHtml of a select tag? what do you set it to?
	iroughley	it's easy and whatever is called on the server to get the data out of the session can format it to html
	iroughley	I would think that any tag can be gotten by id, and then html set in it
	iroughley	so &lt;OPTION&gt;one&lt;/OPTION&gt; etc.
	PSquad32_	i'm going to play a game of halo -- be back in a few :)
	jcarreira	yes, but what do you set into the innerHtml of a select tag to populate it? is it just the &lt;options&gt;?
	iroughley	i think so
	iroughley	haven't tried it, but it makes sense
	jcarreira	ok, so for the tree... it needs to get javascript back, probably, or some data structure... should we support both?
	Fracture	Hi
	jcarreira	Hi Fracture...
	Fracture	i'm going to read the log to catch up
	iroughley	i think that depends on the core tree widget that we use and augment for the implementation
	jcarreira	true... I've been playing with dtree for a while... it's pretty easy
	jcarreira	Fracture, I'm not sure who you are IRL...
	iroughley	do you think that returning JS or HTML would be easier with dtree?
	jcarreira	JS
	iroughley	i think that's fine then - the action/object that obtains the data from the session can modify it to JS to return to the browser
	jcarreira	This is how I add things to the tree:
	jcarreira	&lt;ww:iterator value=&quot;categories&quot;&gt;
	jcarreira	tree.add(&lt;ww:property value=&quot;id&quot;/&gt;,&lt;ww:property value=&quot;(parentCategory == null)?0:parentCategory.id&quot;/&gt;,'&lt;ww:property value=&quot;name&quot;/&gt;','javascript:changeCategory(&lt;ww:property value=&quot;id&quot;/&gt;);','&lt;ww:property value=&quot;name&quot;/&gt;','_top','/img/folder.gif','/img/folderopen.gif');
	jcarreira	&lt;/ww:iterator&gt;
	jcarreira	then you add it to the page like this:
	jcarreira	document.write(tree);
	iroughley	cool
	iroughley	we could even use JS for the select - just an implementation detail, as it will be hidden from teh end user
	jcarreira	but I think we can get to that later... I'm ok hardwiring this one together for now.. but we should make it easy to create components that send changes to the server to update server state and then send update events on topics
	Fracture	is Cameron :)
	jcarreira	ahh.. ok...
	=-=	Fracture is now known as Cameron-
	jcarreira	Cameron, let us know when you're caught up
	Cameron-	shall do .. half way there.
	iroughley	i would agree with that
	iroughley	while we are handwiring, we should also start thinking about a naming convention for the topics
	jcarreira	categoryChange, userChange, etc?
	iroughley	yes - I have been using topic_{html id}_event - i.e. topic_myRemoteDivId_refresh
	iroughley	but they can easily change
	jcarreira	I think we should make it easy to type and remember... users will end up needing to do some wiring themselves at some point
	iroughley	makes sense
	iroughley	on some of the elements i added a topic to publish to - perhaps I should go ahead and add this to them all
	jcarreira	where would we be defining topics?
	iroughley	at the moment I autowire some, and give the user the option of specifying them on some
	jcarreira	well, we should talk through that with Patrick... how we're going to position this Ajax stuff... if we're going to add attributes to the taglibs, etc.
	jcarreira	which are autowired?
	jcarreira	brb
	iroughley	from memory I think the autowired ones are - remotediv sends a &quot;refesh&quot;, tab header sends a &quot;tab selected&quot;
	iroughley	remote div can specify a topic to listen to and refrsh itself - i think that might be the only one for now
	Cameron-	ok - I agree that these dojo widgets that I have created really belong in dojo - or a separate project. I was just demonstrating that rather than us write javascript code (that the ww components use) we write them as dojo widgets, and use the components to bind data to them. When using more interactive client controls - webwork more becomes a controller for marshaling data. I do think that we need to bundle a dojo build with w
	iroughley	oh - the remote link / &lt;a href&gt; is autowired to send a &quot;refresh&quot;
	Cameron-	and also allow our users to use a different profile build - if they meet our dependencies
	PSquad32_	cameron: this whole dependency on dojo widgets is very un-webwork-ish
	PSquad32_	i _really_ think it is not the right direction
	Cameron-	we depend on DRW, we depend on XmlHttpRequest..
	Cameron-	we have to have dependencies
	PSquad32_	but we're depending on a framework
	PSquad32_	the others are libraries
	PSquad32_	dojo is a framework
	PSquad32_	think about it from user's perspective. when they upgrade to 2.2, what are they going to see?
	PSquad32_	what is the &quot;webwork message&quot;?
	PSquad32_	what is our story? we can't have 4 different versions of the same story
	jcarreira	well, that's where we need to decide if this is a theme
	jcarreira	I think this is the Ajax theme
	jcarreira	and it requires dojo
	jcarreira	I think we bundle a dojo profile with the example app
	PSquad32_	i think that is fine (a lot of this is marketing more than anything)
	iroughley	are there cases where you might needs to utilize multiple themes for a single compnent?
	jcarreira	yes
	iroughley	i.e. 2 different styles of lists or tabbed controls on the same page
	iroughley	so each of these would then need to be developed from teh core ajax theme
	jcarreira	sometimes I end up using the &quot;simple&quot; theme because the layout requires I can't put it in the table
	jcarreira	what do you mean?
	iroughley	it's late - i think i just confused myself :)
	jcarreira	what's our status with JSP 2?
	jcarreira	with JSP 2 you can just add more attributes without having to put them in the TLD, right?
	PSquad32_	i am fine iwth requiring jsp 2
	jcarreira	I don't really know the features of JSP 2 :-)
	jcarreira	but requiring JSP 2 is requiring J2EE 1.4 and J2SE 1.4, right?
	jcarreira	which means no WebSphere 4.x or 5.0
	PSquad32_	websphere 5 is JDK 1.4
	jcarreira	5.1 is
	iroughley	if that is the case i would opt not to exclude those markets
	PSquad32_	that's fine
	PSquad32_	we don't need JSP 2 features
	PSquad32_	ww:param works
	PSquad32_	i have to run
	PSquad32_	let's keep thinking about what the webwork story is -- how all this fits in
	PSquad32_	we can't just say the old stuff doens't matter or isn't supported
	Cameron-	so Pat - what is the wework story ?
	PSquad32_	well, i think we all need to work on that
	PSquad32_	i'll draft up some thoughts -- maybe you guys can too
	jcarreira	ok, so if not JSP2, then we need to pull those attributes out and use ww:param to parameterize the tag for this specific theme
	PSquad32_	my main concern is that you guys understand what i'm saying :)
	PSquad32_	anyway, i have to run
	PSquad32_	see ya
	jcarreira	later
	Cameron-	bye
	iroughley	later
	jcarreira	so if this is going to be a theme, we can't add theme-specific attributes
	iroughley	for the remote div that cameron added - right?
	Cameron-	you can - using ww:param no ?
	jcarreira	right, I mean attributes to the TLD
	Cameron-	you could probably add optional ones, and document them as 'only used for xxx theme'
	jcarreira	Hmm... could be.... as long as it's very clear... I don't want to be answering questions about why the topic isn't being used with the xhtml theme
	Cameron-	true
	jcarreira	speaking of which, does anyone know if someone actually build a real XHTML theme using div's and CSS instead of tables?
	jcarreira	built
	iroughley	no idea
	Cameron-	no idea
	iroughley	a while back i thought cloves and pat were talking about doing it
	Cameron-	yeah - I rememer hearing that.
	iroughley	so the plan is to move forward with a dojo/ajax theme?
	jcarreira	yes
	jcarreira	who wants to take what?
	Cameron-	with regards to your 'topics' ... are they for use client side .. or do these events get routed to an action too ?
	jcarreira	Cameron, you're going to talk to the dojo guys about contributing the remote div, remote link, and remote submit stuff to dojo?
	jcarreira	they're the dojo.event.Topic stuff that lets you do publish/subscribe in JS
	Cameron-	yep - i'll do that.
	iroughley	we will also require theme specific tags then, right?
	Cameron-	so you use topics for inter widget communication ?
	iroughley	remote div for example
	jcarreira	I built it as a wrapper around their event stuff
	iroughley	yes - mainly for server side refreshes at the moment
	jcarreira	I think let's keep the theme specific attributes for now
	jcarreira	the idea is for a component to update its server state then publish a message on a topic
	Cameron-	so something emits an event, a widget is triggered, which then refreshes itself ?
	Cameron-	sure
	jcarreira	yep, the developer specifies with the tags which topic(s) a component listens to to refresh itself
	iroughley	or parts of itself - like the drop down list elements
	jcarreira	and which topic a component publishes on when it is changed
	jcarreira	so they are loosely coupled and the developer specifies which thing listens to the others
	Cameron-	cool.
	jcarreira	so about dojo and source
	iroughley	so - there are 3 parts as i see it - 1. the dojo UI widgets, 2. the events/topics, and 3. the WW tag/component that combines them all
	Cameron-	yep
	iroughley	go ahead jason
	jcarreira	should we just bundle the __package__.js?
	Cameron-	we also need the other 'non bundled' files.. like html templates, css files and other widget resources (gif/jpg)
	jcarreira	yeah, the tags generate JS to use the dojo widgets and JS to wire them to topics
	jcarreira	ok
	jcarreira	where do those come from?
	Cameron-	I setup an ant target dojo-profile that causes dojo to build a __package__.js and copy it and other non bundled resources into the os/static/dojo package
	Cameron-	where do those come from ? dunno what you mean
	jcarreira	Well, I don't know about bundling the sources to dojo into webwork's CVS
	jcarreira	I think we should just bundle the final built product, like we do with other libraries
	iroughley	also, if they are in webwork.static, can the end user override the images easily if they wanted?
	Cameron-	that depends on how the widet is authored
	Cameron-	authored
	jcarreira	how does one specify the images to be used?
	jcarreira	can it be done so that the template could be edited to change where they come from?
	Cameron-	the widget can take a img= attribute and use it in the building of the rendered widget.
	iroughley	ok - so it doesn't need to be in ww.static
	jcarreira	well, the defaults can be
	Cameron-	doesn't have to be.. however .. defaults may be packaged there
	iroughley	ok - makes sense
	jcarreira	ok, so the order of things:
	jcarreira	1) Cameron, you're going to try to get this stuff into dojo
	jcarreira	2) we build a profiles of dojo with the widgets
	jcarreira	3) we edit the JSP templates to use the dojo widgets
	jcarreira	sound good?
	jcarreira	anything i'm missing?
	iroughley	sounds good
	Cameron-	with the remote div.. why do we need a jsp template ?
	jcarreira	because we want to wire it to topics
	Cameron-	why not have a &lt;dojo:topic&gt; widget ?
	jcarreira	and it can take the body contents as the default content of the div
	Cameron-	the body content can be done &lt;dojo:remotediv attribs...&gt;&lt;ww:action name='foo'/&gt;&lt;/dojo:remotediv&gt;
	jcarreira	what would the dojo:topic do?
	Cameron-	the dojo:topic would 'install' the topic 'bus' into the page
	jcarreira	well, I'd like to keep things consistent... using ww: tags and auto-wiring them to topics
	iroughley	can th edojo:topic tag specify the topic to listen to and the topic to publish to when an event ocurrs?
	iroughley	it's also going to be more code for developers to type
	jcarreira	&lt;ww:remotediv listenTopic=&quot;itemSelected&quot;&gt; creates JS to wire the div to refresh when it gets a message on that topic
	jcarreira	yeah, we want to make this dead-simple
	Cameron-	dojo:remotediv listenTopic='itemSelected'&gt; can do the same thing.. without a jsp template
	jcarreira	...and it doesn't hurt to wrap dojo in case something else comes along and we replace the JS library
	Cameron-	I think we only need to use a jsp tag when we need to access action context from the tag
	jcarreira	I don't want to make users know anything about dojo
	Cameron-	ok.. well. I think we have two different approaches.
	iroughley	if we don't wrap it, it won't really be a theme - wil it?
	jcarreira	yeah, the JSP template can just call the dojo stuff, so you can just use the dojo stuff directly, too
	iroughley	it will be something else to use with ww
	Cameron-	ok
	jcarreira	well... maybe we should just make this a ww:div tag
	iroughley	makes sense
	jcarreira	and in the Ajax theme it can become a remote div
	iroughley	then we also need a &lt;ww:a&gt;
	iroughley	:)
	jcarreira	yeah... we should do that
	jcarreira	it can use the URLTag code
	Cameron-	sounds good
	jcarreira	ok, Ian, do you want to take those?
	iroughley	sure
	jcarreira	cool
	iroughley	we also need dojo components for the existing elements - remote div, remote a link, tabbed panel - right?
	jcarreira	yeah... not sure how hard it is to do the tabbed panel... that's a more complicated one
	iroughley	tonight we also talked about a select list and tree element
	iroughley	it might be easy - just use &lt;ww:div&gt; and it will just not update - events will be the only issue
	jcarreira	...and I still want them to build a nice menuing system :-)
	iroughley	the only other thing I was thinking about is a paginated list
	jcarreira	let's get the ones we've got now using the new architecture
	jcarreira	JSP tag -&gt; template -&gt; dojo widget
	iroughley	cameron - you up for building the dojo components?
	Cameron-	yeah
	jcarreira	ok, I'll fill Patrick in with where we're heading and maybe we can schedule another chat to talk about the WebWork message, etc
	Cameron-	ok
	iroughley	ok - then I will start on the remote div tag/template from teh dojo component next monday
	Cameron-	we need a wiki page to list the ajax theme components
	Cameron-	(so I know what to build)
	iroughley	let me know as new ones come down the pipe
	iroughley	the current tutorial list all the ones i've done - localhost/webwork/tutorial/ajax/...
