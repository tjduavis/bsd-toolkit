Q3: Bonus Question  (2 marks)

What is the runtime of the function?
int isprime(int N){
  int rc=(N<=2)?1:(N%2);
  for(int i=3;i*i<=N;i+=2){
    if(N%i==0)
     rc=0;
  }
  return rc;
}


The run time of this function is O (N). Even tho the i*i <= N constraints growth of the loop. The loop still increments grows at a a linear growth. If you would graph this, the line would start at a higher y axis and have a steeper slope.
